# PeerConnect.ai

PeerConnect.ai is an AI-powered platform designed to help students find ideal learning partners. Developed for a hackathon, the platform allows students to either add themselves to a list or find their best peer match using an AI model. The Google Gemini API provides detailed explanations for why a particular peer is a good match based on the student's profile.

### Problem Statement
In educational settings, students often struggle to find suitable peers for collaborative learning and peer tutoring. Traditional methods of pairing students based on basic criteria like availability and subjects of interest often fall short in identifying the best matches that can truly enhance learning experiences. There is a need for a more sophisticated, AI-powered solution that can match students based on a deeper understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, learning styles, and feedback.
